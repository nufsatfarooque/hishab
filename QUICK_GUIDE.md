## 📊 Understanding Your Budget

### Daily Allowance Formula
```
Daily Allowance = (Monthly Income - Total Spent This Month) ÷ Days Remaining in Month
```

**Example:**
- Monthly Income: ৳30,000
- Spent so far: ৳10,000
- Days remaining: 20
- Daily Allowance: (30,000 - 10,000) ÷ 20 = ৳1,000/day

### What This Means
If your daily allowance is ৳1,000:
- Spend under ৳800/day → Green status ✅
- Spend ৳800-1,000/day → Yellow status ⚠️
- Spend over ৳1,000/day → Red status 🚨
